## Challenge Problem 6
### Using Pandas
#### I worked alongside Jake G!

1. Download the data folder with the supported csv file (2015.csv)
2. Run code.

#### The program will execute and write information to a new csv file. It will also create a directory called "build".
#### Within the new build directory there will be two separate csv files and the new files created for average number of teams per institution, number of teams entered per institution, institutions with outstanding ranking, and finally, meritorious ranking or better for schools in the USA. 
### The other two csv files will contain team information and the other with institution information.
